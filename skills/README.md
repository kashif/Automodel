# Skills

Reusable task guides for AI coding agents working in this repo.

Skills are defined centrally here and symlinked into the agentic directories
that need them, keeping a single source of truth without polluting personal
`.claude/skills/` setups.

## Usage

Skills are synced to the global Claude Code skill registry via CI and are
available to AI agents as invocable slash commands without any extra flags.

To invoke a skill manually, use `/<skill-name>` in your Claude Code session.
